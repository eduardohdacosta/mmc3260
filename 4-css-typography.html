            <h1>About Me</h1>
          
            <p>My name is Eduardo DaCosta, and I am a student of marketing and information systems at the University of Florida under the Warrington College of Business Administration. I am minoring in computer science and mass communications to specialize my area of study.</p>
          
            <p>My professional interests include brand management and consulting with a heavy focus on information technology and graphic and web design. I am actively pursuing the skills required to excell in each career, the market-mindedness necessary for effective and influential decision making, and the personality that makes every action I take or project I take on unique to my talents and my ideas.</p>
          
            <p>While I enthusiastically seek learning in a classroom setting, I also take every opportunity to learn through the experiences I receive as a result of my involvement on the UF campus. From actively advancing brotherhood in a professional fraternity to consulting with local Gainesville businesses to organizing college-wide events for the students of my college, I very much enjoy the parts I play in the organizations I am passionate about furthering.</p>
          
            <p>Aside from that, I draw inspiration and enjoyment from a number of different outlets: </p>
          
            <ul>
	 		    <li>The community driven works of John and Hank Green (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers/videos" rel="external" title="Vlogbrothers">Vlogbrothers</a>)</li> 
	 		    <li>The daily articles posted from <a href="http://www.adage.com" rel="external" title="Ad Age">Advertising Age</a>, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/home-page" rel="external" title="Wall Street Journal">WSJ</a>, and <a href="http://www.mashable.com" rel="external" title="Mashable">Mashable.com</a></li>
	 		    <li>A sizeable collection of <a href="http://www.ted.com" rel="external" title="TED">TED talks</a></li>
	 		    <li>The social media outlets I maintain from Twitter to GitHub to Tumblr</li>
	 		    <li>The piano sitting in my living room</li>
                <li>My faith and relationship with Jesus Christ</li>
                <li>The proudly quirky family and motivated group of peers with whom I consistently surround myself</li>
          </ul>             
          
            <p>
                I look forward to connecting with you in the near future.</p>
